## Tracking freely behaving specimens in real time

PyTorch package to enable real-time tracking of freely behaving specimens with high precision and ultralow latency (< 4 ms/frame, > 250 Hz), using generative models, prior-informed position estimation, and inference runtime optimization.
Here an example of a zebrafish larva in a behavioral chamber:

Code will be made public soon!
