## Tracking freely behaving specimens in real time

PyTorch package for high precision, ultra low latency behavioral tracking (< 4 ms/frame, > 250 Hz), utilizing prior-informed position estimation and inference runtime optimization.

a: Trace of larval zebrafish (danio rerio) in behavioral arena over the course of a 1.68 million frame experiment (1.86 hours).\
b: The specimen freely moves in the arena while being tracked. Relevant behavioral data can accurately be recorded in real time with high temporal resolution, enabling the study of corresponding neural activity during unconstrained behavior.
